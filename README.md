Social network data analysis for fire events.

In current repository there is a draft approach for creating a Convolutional Neural Network model for classifying social network data images as related and not related to fire events.

Scripts are written in R. Moreover, some training data, images classified as related and not related to fire are provided for re-execution purposes. 
The demo-model is also attached in the repository.
As stated in paper, Neural Network classification is at early stage, the related files are provided as justification of that initial creation of a CNN image classification model.
